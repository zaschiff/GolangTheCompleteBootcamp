GOPATH -
    Is the environment variable pointing to a folder under the user directory 
    that contains the source code for the go installation. They are in the src 
    directory and it is common practice to store source code in the package 
    to which it is named.

Code syntax -
    package 'package name' ==> this is the package clause and is the first line
    of code. It declares the name of the package that the go file belongs to.
    if it is not named Main, go will nto execute the code.

    func ==> the keyword to declare a named function that we create.
    The funciton named main is the entry point to the program.

Use the go tools in the command line to run or build your code.
    To build and executable, use go buil 'file name'
    To build, run, and delete the executable in one command use go run 'file name'

Packages -
    There are rules
        R1. All package files that should be in the same directory
        R2. All files in the same directory should belong to the same package
    Each Go package has it's own scope
    There are only two kinds of Go packages: Executable and Library
        Executbale ==> declared with package mian and has a main funcction. Only created for running as program. Not importable
        Library ==> package name matches folder directory and does not containt a main function.It is created only for reusability. 
            importable but not executable
    
Scopes -
    scope is the visibility of an object. Who can see the object.
    Declaration ==> delcares a unique name bound to a scope. Same name cannnot be declared twice with in the same scope.
    
    objects outside a function (like inbetween the import statement and the first function) are package scope, the entire pacakge can see the object.
    If an object is clared between {}, this is considered blocked scope. The object is only visible between matching {}.

    File scope is all objects are visible to the file. Each Go file has it's own scope.

Importing -
    allows a file to use the functionalities from a library package. Importing only happens as the file level.

    Imports can be renmaed to allow duplicate pakcge importing. 
        apply the alias between the import statement and the name of the package 
        ie: import f "fmt", this sets an alias 'f' for the 'fmt' import.

Statments -
    statements instruct go to do something. 
    They are generally one line of code unless separated by a semicolon (;).
    They control the execution flow.

Expressions - 
    line of code that computes one or more values.
    expressions should be used with or within a statement.
    some statements like func calls can also act like expressions.

Comments -
    use comments to explain or document code.
    a single line comment is stated with //
    a multi line comment starts with a /* and ends with */
    There is a command in go to create documentaiton about the project using the comments in the file automatically. 
        The tool is called go doc

Exporting - 
    allows a package to make its functionalities available to other packages.
    To export something, after declaring the name of anobject make the first letter of the name capitlaized
        ie: var cheese string, the variable cheese is not exported. var Cheese string is an exported variable.

Variables -
    is a storage box for a value. They can be named or unanmed and when called give you access to the value inside. 
    a static type is a type of variable that can not have its typed changed once declared. However, you can change the value 
    to another value as long as it is the same type.

    Basic data types - 
        most basic types in go
        int         => a whole number, signed or unsigned ie: -1 0 27
        float64     => a non-whole number ie: .5 0. 1.2
        bool        => only represent true or false
        strng       => a word or multiple charachters ie: "hi" "hello there"

    Declaring a Variable, Syntax -
        must be delcared before you can use. 
         syntax is as follows: var speed int
            var     ==> keyword to declare a variable
            speed   ==> name fo the variable or also known as the identifier
            int     ==> type of the variable
    
        In go every variables have a type

        Naming rules:
            names should always start with a letter or underscore character.
            names can not start with numbers or punctuation marks
            names can not contian punctuation marks
            names can not use keywords from go.

        if not initialized to a value, go will initialize a variable to it's zero value
        Zero values get applied to an emtpy variable according to it's type
            int         ==> 0
            float       ==> 0
            bool        ==> false
            string      ==> ""
            pointers    ==> nil

    Blank Identifier -
        go does not allow declaraion of unused variables. Unused variables cause maintenance nightmares. 
        You are not required to use package level variables.

        allows us to use and discard the value of a variable. 
    
    Multiple variables can be declared using the comma (,) as a separator as long as they are the same type or 
        you can wrap them in parentheses () after the var keyword if the types are different

    Initialization can be done at the saem time as declaration using the assingment operator (=)

    Go uses type inference. This means that the compiler can figure out the type of variable using the vlaue that it contains.

    Short declaration is a variable declaration syntax that declares and initializes the value in one statement. The short declaraion operator is :=
        Short declaration works at block scope, it can't be used for package scope variables.
    The short declaration can be used with mutliple variable assignment. they do not need to be the same type to usse :=
    It acan also be used on a previsoulse declared variable as ong as it is in multiple assignment and at least one new variable is new.

    When deciding to use a short variable vs normal - 
        Use Normal Declaration when:
            When you don't know the initial value
            When you need a package scope variable
            When you want to group variables together for readability

        Use Short declaration when: (mostly used and preferred)
            When you know the initial value.
            to keep code concise
            for redeclaration

    Assignment -
        use the assignment operator (=) to change the value of a variable. This doesn't declare a new variable.
        When assigning a value to a varibale it MUST match the type of the variable.
        the assignment operator supports multiple variable assignment.
        Using the multiple assingment sytanx we can swap two variables.
        
Type Conversion -
    since we have mutliple types, we may nee to take one type and make it into another. Go offers type conversion.
        the syntax for type conversion is similar to many other languages. 
            type(value)
        
        type  ==> the type we want to convert to
        value ==> value we are trying to convert.

Type Names -
    the type indicates the type and the size of the type. An Int32 is 4 bytes long and it is not the same as int.

Slices -
    Slices is a go type that can store multiple values
    syntax is [] and the type it will store. Once declared it can only store that type. IE []string, is a slice of strings only
    Go is a zero index language. We acces the items in a slice using index number inside [] ie [0] is the first item in a slice

Printf - 
    prints formatted output.
    the syntax for printf is similar to many other print functionalities but with addtional functionality
        Printf("%q\n", variable)
            Printf  ==> the function call
            %q      ==> the formatting text, determines the what and how to print.
            variabe ==> replacer values, these are the values that replace the formatted text.
    verbs can be used as many times as wanted and with other verbs.

Escape Sequences -
    special modifier that gives special meaning in the print functions. They are always denoted by a a backslash (\)
    due to this we need to escape any symbols that are used in a string that activate special meanings like if we need a backslash in a string we type \\
    
    Escape sequences:
        \a          - alert or bell
        \b          - backspace
        \f          - form feed
        \n          - new line
        \r          - carriage return
        \t          - horizontal tab
        \v          - vertical tab
        \\          - backslash
        \"          - double quotes
        \ooo        - octal digit
        \xhh        - byte, h is hex
        \uhhhh      - unicode, h is hex digits
        /Uhhhhhhhh  - unicode, h is 8 hex hex digits

Formatter input -
    %T - Type of the value passed
    %v - value in default format
    
    others can be found at https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/
    we can pass an arguments index to the formatting verb to select which argument we want using []

Arithmetic Operators -
    Normal math operations can be done using the normal operators in go
        * - multiplication
        + - addtiona
        - - subtraction/negation
        / - division
        % - remainder or modulus, only works on integers
    Computers struggle with floating part numbers and can create inaccuracies based on precision. BE CAREFUL!!!
