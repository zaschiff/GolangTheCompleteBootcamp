    that contains the source code for the go installation. They are in the src 
    directory and it is common practice to store source code in the package 
    to which it is named.

Code syntax -
    package 'package name' --> this is the package clause and is the first line
    of code. It declares the name of the package that the go file belongs to.
    if it is not named Main, go will nto execute the code.

    func --> the keyword to declare a named function that we create.
    The funciton named main is the entry point to the program.
