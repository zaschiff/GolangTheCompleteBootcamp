This repo holds the code for the Udemy Class Go (Golang): The Complete Bootcamp by Jose Portilla and Inanc Gumus

## Folders
    Most folders in this repo are for eithe course work or my following along

    __learngo__
        this folder is the course work provided by the instructor. I have cloned his repo from 
        https://github.com/inangumus/learngo/ in order to keep course materials close at hand.

    __MyWork__
        This folder is the location for my work and notes. I will keep the work I do and code I type in here to 
        separate it from course materials. The _Notes.txt._ file is where I will write up my notes on the subject.
        It will always remain in the MyWork folder.
