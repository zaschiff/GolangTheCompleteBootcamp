# GolangTheCompleteBootcamp

This repo holds the code for the Udemy Class Go (Golang): The Complete Bootcamp by Jose Portilla and Inanc Gumus

## Folders

Most folders in this repo are for either course work or my following along

__learngo__  
this folder is the course work provided by the instructor. I have cloned his repo from <https://github.com/inangumus/learngo/> in order to keep course materials close at hand.

__MyWork__  
This folder is the location for my work and notes. I will keep the work I do and code I type in here to separate it from course materials. The _Notes.txt._ file is where I will write up my notes on the subject.
It will always remain in the MyWork folder.
